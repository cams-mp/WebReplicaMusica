                Ooh <br>
                I <br>
                <br>
                I just woke up from a dream <br>
                Where you and I had to say goodbye <br>
                And I don't know what it all means <br>
                But since I survived, I realized <br>
                <br>
                Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow <br>
                Nobody's promised tomorrow <br>
                So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night <br>
                Like it's the last night <br>
                <br>
                If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you <br>
                If the party was over and our time on Earth was through <br>
                I'd wanna hold you just for a while <br>
                And die with a smile <br>
                If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you <br>
                <br>
                Woo-ooh <br>
                <br>
                Ooh, lost
                Lost in the words that we scream <br>
                I don't even wanna do this anymore <br>
                'Cause you already know what you mean to me <br>
                And our love is the only war worth fighting for <br>
                <br>
                Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow <br>
                Nobody's promised tomorrow <br>
                So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night <br>
                Like it's the last night <br>
                <br>
                If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you <br>
                If the party was over and our time on Earth was through <br>
                I'd wanna hold you just for a while <br>
                And die with a smile <br>
                If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you <br>
                <br>
                Right next to you <br>
                Next to you <br>
                Right next to you <br>
                Oh-oh-oh <br>
                <br>
                If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you <br>
                If the party was over and our time on Earth was through <br>

                Ooh, ooh <br>
                I'd wanna be next to you <br>
